For cocoa pods install……first…
Step 1 (install HomeBrew)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)
  Step 2 (Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH)
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/”YOUR USER FORLDER”/.zprofile
  eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
  Step 3 (now you can install cocoapods)
brew install cocoapods


Second way…….

Open Terminal
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
Reopen Terminal
rvm install ruby-2.6

rvm use ruby-2.6.5

rvm --default use 2.6.5
Then this installed cocoapods as expected
sudo gem install cocoapods
